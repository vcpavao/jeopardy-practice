To Do:

Track statistics (e.g. percent correct, which categories need most improvement, etc)

Permit more leninent responses
(e.g. typing in "Patton" when the answer in the database is "George Patton" is currently determined to be incorrect)

Implement machine learning to organize testing of clues that were responded to incorrectly
